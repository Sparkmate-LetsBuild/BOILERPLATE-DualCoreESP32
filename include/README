# Includes folder

Use this folder to define bricks, configs, and basically all supplementary components to your code. The way we write firmware code at Sparkmate is:

```
src/main.cpp                    ← include/configs/*
↑
include/main_task_handler.h     ← ''
↑
include/tasks/*                 ← ''
↑
include/inits/*                 ← '', (used for select bricks only)
↑
include/bricks/*                ← ''
↑
lib/*                           ← ''
```

We do this to increase code readability, scalability, cross-compatibility, and logic, so please stick to the format.

**Why no src (.cpp) files as well as the header (.h) files?**

[You don't need both anymore!](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1305947/why-does-c-need-a-separate-header-file#:~:text=The%20answer%20is%20that%20C%2B%2B,everything%20in%20the%20header%20files.) _(you should be using `pragma once`)_
